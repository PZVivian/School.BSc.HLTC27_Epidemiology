# HLTC27 Community Health and Epidemiology
This is a proposal for a case-control study on traffic-related air pollution and asthma among children in Toronto, Canada. It was written for a third-year course, HLTC27 Community Health and Epidemiology, at the University of Toronto during my undergraduate studies.
